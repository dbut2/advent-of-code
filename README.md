### Advent of Code

Advent of Code solutions for some of 2019-2023, mostly in Go

Some solutions may have a v2 solution if I've attempted a more efficient/effective solution

All Go solutions should be runnable through just `go run`ning the **file**. I make no guarantees for older solutions being runnable as I update my packages frequently, but generally the most recent solutions will work.
