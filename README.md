### Advent of Code

Advent of Code solutions for some of 2020-2024, mostly in Go

All Go solutions should be runnable through `go run`ning the **file**.
Most solutions use an embedded file `input.txt` for the input, so make sure this exists if you are attempting to run.

e.g.
```shell
$ go run ./2024/01/01.go
```

Only solutions for the current year are guaranteed to be runnable, there is some efforts in resolving issues from previous years though the solutions exist just for reference at that point.

### Utility Packages

Included are some utility functions and packages to increase efficiency of solving.

Notable examples:
- **Harness**: Framework for running each challenge, handling input and managing expectations of test example input and output.
- **Lists**: Implementation of stack, queue, linked list, and doubly linked list.
- **Math**: Generic mathematical functions replacing the use of the builtins `float64` functions.
- **Space**: Data structures for dealing with 2D and 3D spacial problems with integer based coordinate systems.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of well known cs algorithms such as Dijkstra's.

The packages found in this repo are free to use or reference. It's recommend to pin to a commit if you are importing as there are frequent breaking changes, especially during the challenge.
